# 19CS406-EX-1 STUDY OF SOCKET PROGRAMMING WITH CLIENT-SERVER MODEL

DATE :08-03-2023

# AIM :
To implement socket programming date and time display from client to server using TCPSockets.


# ALGORITHM :
## Server:
```
1.Create a server socket and bind it to port.
2.Listen for new connection and when a connection arrives, accept it.
3.Send server‟s date and time to the client.
4.Read client‟s IP address sent by the client.
5.Display the client details.
6.Repeat steps 2-5 until the server is terminated.
7.Close all streams.
8.Close the server socket.
9.Stop.
```
## Client:
```
1.Create a client socket and connect it to the server‟s port number.
2.Retrieve its own IP address using built-in function.
3.Send its address to the server.
4.Display the date & time sent by the server.
5.Close the input and output streams.
6.Close the client socket.
7.Stop.
```
# PROGRAM :
## CLIENT :
```
# Developed by : P. Bhagyasri Reddy
# Register Number : 212220040126
import socket
from datetime import datetime
s=socket.socket()
s.bind(('localhost',8000))
s.listen(5)
c,addr=s.accept()
print("Client Address : ",addr)
now = datetime.now()
c.send(now.strftime("%d/%m/%Y %H:%M:%S").encode())
ack=c.recv(1024).decode()
if ack:
    print(ack)
    c.close()
```
## SERVER :
```
# Developed by : P. Bhagyasri Reddy
# Register Number : 212220040126
import socket
s=socket.socket()
s.connect(('localhost',8000))
print(s.getsockname())
print(s.recv(1024).decode())
s.send("acknowledgement recived from the server".encode())
```

# OUTPUT:
## CLIENT :

# RESULT:
Thus, the program to implement socket programming date and time display from client to server using TCP Sockets was successfully executed.
